One (of many) reasons I love cooking: it provides an antidote to so many of the problems of modernity. 

**Unhealthy food is everywhere**
-> Cooking gives you full control of what you put into your body.

**We spend way too much time in front of screens**
-> Cooking is sensory, tactile, and roots you firmly back in the physical world. 

**The modern world is fast-paced, high-stress, and distracting**
-> Cooking requires you to be intensely present. It encourages you to slow down, pay attention, and focus on the task at hand. 

**Everything is getting way more expensive**
-> Cooking at home is by far the best way to save money on food. 

**We're disconnected from nature**
-> Food and cooking offer the opportunity to connect with nature and with your local environment. 

**We're disconnected from one another** 
-> Cooking is the oldest and best way of fostering community and social connection. The easiest improvement to your social life you can make is cooking and sharing that with friends and family.

I truly believe that we all need more of these things. I constantly talk about cooking because I believe it's incredibly powerful. Adopt it as a regular practice and watch it transform your life.
