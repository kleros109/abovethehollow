## Summary

The [article](https://helpx.adobe.com/firefly/work-with-audio-and-video/work-with-video/writing-effective-text-prompts-for-video-generation.html) advises being clear and descriptive in your prompts, specifying visual style and defining actions clearly. It recommends structuring prompts like this: **Shot Type Description + Character + Action + Location + Aesthetic**. Using descriptive adjectives helps set the atmosphere, and providing context or background stories is useful for complex projects.

**Key points include:**

- Use specific camera angles and movements (e.g., "wide angle shot," "drone footage," "point-of-view") to simulate real-world camera work.
- Include temporal elements like time of day and weather to influence the video's mood.
- Refine prompts through trial and error, starting basic and adding details iteratively.
- Firefly can generate elements useful for editing, such as transition masks, elements on green/black backgrounds, and overlays.
- While there's no strict prompt length limit, vivid details and concrete language yield more predictable results.
