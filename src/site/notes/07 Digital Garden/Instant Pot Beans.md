## Directions

- I usually make in the instant pot for 35mins on high.
- For 1 lb beans, saut√© 1 diced onion and 2-4 minced garlic cloves. 
- When soft, add 1 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon oregano, 1.5 teaspoon salt, and 1-2 teaspoon chili powder. 
- Add beans and stir. Add 6 cups water.
- Close and pressure cook. 
- Let pressure reduce naturally for at least 10 mins after done.
- Add a little red wine or sherry vinegar to taste.
