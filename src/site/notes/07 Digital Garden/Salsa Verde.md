![The most popular Mexican table sauce](https://youtu.be/6_RmlLgBGD0?si=mwkp_zWoALUEGuHf)

## Ingredients

- 8 tomatillos
    
- 2 serrano chiles (or jalapenos), stems cut off
    
- 1/4 white onion
    
- 1 garlic clove
    
- Handful of cilantro
    
- Salt to taste

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450 F (232 C).
    
2. Add the tomatillos, serranos, onion, and garlic clove to a baking sheet. Place in the preheated oven and roast until dark and roasty.
    
3. Remove the skin from the garlic clove and if the tomatillo skins are black and burnt remove those too (I like to keep them in). Place all the roasted ingredients in a blender or food processor with a sprinkle of salt. Pulse until desired consistency is reached, do not over blend.
    
4. Taste it, add more salt as needed. Thin out with water if needed.
    
    - **Note:** Since tomatillos are tart it may need more salt than a normal salsa to round out the flavor.
