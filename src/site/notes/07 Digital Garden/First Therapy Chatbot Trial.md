## Summary
Dartmouth researchers conducted a clinical trial of an AI therapy chatbot called Therabot, finding it significantly improved mental health symptoms in participants. Users reported high levels of trust and engagement, treating Therabot like a friend, and many experienced substantial reductions in issues like depression and anxiety. While the results are promising, experts emphasize the need for ongoing oversight and safety measures in using AI for mental health support.
