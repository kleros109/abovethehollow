## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 large yellow onion, chopped
- 2 celery ribs, finely chopped
- 2 large carrots, peeled and finely chopped
- 1 (28-ounce) can whole stewed tomatoes or crushed tomatoes, depending on cooking method
- 1 (3Â½-pound) chuck roast, fat trimmed, cut into approximately 2-inch pieces
- 1 to 2 cups beef stock
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 teaspoons ground allspice
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 bay leaves

## Directions

- Using the saute function, heat the oil in a 6-8 quart Instant Pot. Once the oil is glistening, add the onion, celery, and carrots. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the whole stewed tomatoes, breaking them up with your hands. Add the beef, 1 cup of the stock, the garlic, allspice, cinnamon, salt, pepper, thyme, and bay leaves. Stir to incorporate.
- Lock the lid in place, being sure to close the vent valve, and cook on high pressure for 35 minutes. Allow the pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes, then quick release if needed.
- Using tongs or two forks, shred the beef in the pot, discarding any large fat pieces of fat. Stir to incorporate the beef, then using the saute function, cook until the sauce slightly thickens, about 3-5 minutes, stirring often to avoid burning.

## Notes

- Polenta, cooked pasta, zucchini noodles, or spaghetti squash, for serving
