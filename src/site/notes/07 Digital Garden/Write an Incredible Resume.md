[Write an Incredible Resume - 5 Golden Rules](https://youtu.be/Tt08KmFfIYQ?si=ZSlyVJ2mWZtNqymp)

### Summary (Gemini)
This video is about writing an incredible resume based on the findings from analyzing 125,484 resumes. Here are the five key takeaways:

1. **Include a Linkedin profile on your resume**. Resumes with a Linkedin profile see higher interview rates, but only if your profile is comprehensive. A comprehensive profile includes a professional headshot, informative work details, and meaningful connections.
2. **Include the right keywords and skills**. Applicant tracking systems scan for keywords to filter out candidates. Include relevant keywords from the job description in your resume. Also, include both hard skills and soft skills relevant to the job description.
3. **Include measurable results in your bullet points**. Quantify your achievements using metrics. This will make your resume stand out and allow employers to understand the impact of your work.
4. **Keep your resume length between 475 and 600 words**. Resumes within this range tend to get double the interviews compared to shorter or longer resumes.
5. **Avoid buzzwords and cliches**. These are unnecessary and take away from your message. Use clear and concise language to describe your experience.
