## Core Philosophy

This system is built around three fundamental principles:

1. **Intentional Attention (Newport):** Focus your cognitive resources on what truly matters
2. **Systems Over Willpower (Allen/Abdaal):** Create reliable processes rather than relying on motivation
3. **Values-Based Priorities (Covey):** Align daily actions with long-term principles

## The Framework

### Strategic Planning Layer (Covey)

- **Quarterly Vision Setting:** Identify 3-5 "big rocks" (major priorities) every 90 days
- **Weekly Planning:** Schedule dedicated time each week to plan the coming days using [[07 Digital Garden/Steven Covey's Roles and Goals Approach\|Steven Covey's Roles and Goals Approach]]
- **Decision Matrix:** Use [[07 Digital Garden/Stephen Covey's Urgent-Important Matrix\|Stephen Covey's Urgent-Important Matrix]] to evaluate incoming tasks

### Operational System (Allen/Pullein)

-  **Capture System:** Create a frictionless method to collect all inputs 
- **Processing Routine:** Daily clarification of inputs into actionable tasks
- **Next Action Focus:** Every project needs a clearly defined next physical action
- **Context Organization:** Organize tasks by energy level, location, or tools required
- **Weekly Review:** Regular system maintenance and reset

### Execution Strategy (Newport/Abdaal)
- **Time Blocking:** Schedule deep work sessions for important projects
- **Digital Minimalism:** Implement boundaries around technology use
- **Task Batching:** Group similar shallow tasks together
- **Progressive Summarization:** Efficiently process information for future retrieval
- **Evidence-Based Methods:** Use techniques like Pomodoro, spaced repetition, and interleaving

## Practical Implementation

### Daily Workflow

1. **Morning Planning (15min):**
   - Review calendar for the day
   - Identify 1-3 MIT 
   - Schedule deep work blocks
   - Review task lists

2. **Execution Periods:**
   - Deep work blocks (60-90min) 
   - Shallow work batches
   - Communication batching

3. **End-of-Day Review (10min):**
   - Capture open loops
   - Prepare for tomorrow
   - Quick journal reflection

### Weekly Workflow

**Weekly Review (60-90min):**
   - Empty all inboxes
   - Review all projects
   - Update task lists
   - Reflect on progress toward quarterly goals
   - Plan the coming week
   - Review [[07 Digital Garden/Weekly Review from Ross Harkness\|Weekly Review from Ross Harkness]]
