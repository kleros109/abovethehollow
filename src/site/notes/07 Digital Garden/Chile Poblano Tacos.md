### Ingredients:

- **Poblano Pepper**: You can substitute with Anaheim, bell, or jalape√±o peppers.
- **Monterey Jack Cheese**: This is suggested as a substitute for Mexican Manchego. Other options include Mexican Manchego, Oaxaca, or Mozzarella.
- **Optional Meat**: Steak or chicken can be added.
- **Marinade for Meat (Optional)**: Mayonnaise, lime zest, lime juice, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, and salt.
- **Toppings**: Hot sauce, pickled onions, or fresh salsa (optional).
- **Tortillas**: Corn tortillas are recommended.

### Directions:

1. Cut open a poblano pepper and insert cheese.
2. Apply high heat to blacken the skin for a charred flavor. You can use a gas grill, coals, a pan under a broiler, or a cast iron over high heat.
3. For a less intense flavor, roast the poblano, then place it in a covered container for 15 minutes to easily remove the skin.
4. Chop the pepper and combine it with cheese.
5. Pan-fry the mixture on medium heat to achieve crispy, browned cheese.
6. Portion the filling onto a warm corn tortilla.
7. Add optional toppings like hot sauce, pickled onions, or fresh salsa.

**Optional Addition of Meat:**

1. Marinate sliced stew meat with mayonnaise, lime zest, lime juice, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, and salt.
2. Brown the marinated meat on a hot griddle.
3. Incorporate the cooked meat into the poblano and cheese mixture.
