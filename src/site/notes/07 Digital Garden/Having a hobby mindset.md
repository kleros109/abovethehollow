## Summary
Having a hobby can bring joy and passion to your life. When you view challenges as part of the journey, it makes the experience more interesting. You can apply this positive mindset to work, making it more productive and enjoyable.

## Highlights

> You might be fortunate enough to have a hobby.
> Something you are focused on and passionate about. You might read the journals, develop your skills, collect, connect with others in the field, and commit to getting better at it…
> Time spent on a hobby feels like time well spent. Obstacles and setbacks aren’t a tragedy, they’re simply part of journey, the things that make it interesting.
> It’s possible to bring that mindset to work. Not all the time, certainly, but often. And when we do, it turns out that work gets more productive and even more fun.
