## Summary
Kai Brach, in issue 267 of Dense Discovery, shares a practice of saving kind emails from readers in a folder titled 'Confidence Boost'. These emails serve as a reminder of the importance of connection and provide a source of motivation during moments of self-doubt or creative blocks. Brach compares this practice to saving money in a bank account, as revisiting these memories pays dividends and provides energy during low moments. These memories act as a map that guides individuals when they feel lost, reminding them of their values and what truly matters to them.

## Highlights

> A memory pays dividends every time you return to it. Collecting artifacts or evidence of them, and organizing them together, is like saving money and putting it into a bank account.
