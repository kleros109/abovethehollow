for uh 0:54 some more torture let's do it I I now 0:57 have friends with me that be 0:58 collectively tortured have you uh have 1:00 you told them how torturous the first 1:02 time was I'm playing 1:08 Nirvana have you heard that song before 1:12 no that is insane really oh that's Fu 1:16 this all 1:18 up well all I can tell you uh Ron has 1:20 something pretty special planned but 1:22 this is going to be a hell of a lot 1:25 worse godp speed to all of you 1:30 we go we go okay so uh in a moment we're 1:33 going to play you song all right and 1:36 it's going to be your challenge to 1:38 reimagine the song as An instrumental 1:41 jazz piece okay okay so you're going to 1:43 have complete creative freedom to change 1:45 chords rhythms tempos anything you want 1:48 cool um but you got to make it like 1:50 Uniquely Yours how much time we 1:53 got we could be here all day the timer 1:57 starts now we don't have a ton of time 1:59 cuz I know you got a gig tonight so yeah 2:00 we got we got to go and actually play 2:02 like a jazz game that's right so there's 2:04 a bit of pressure but uh you can listen 2:07 as many times as you want but I want it 2:09 to be yours do you have any inkling 2:11 about what song this might 2:12 be nope okay you ready you want to hear 2:16 it yes okay here we go 2:21 \[Music\] 2:30 she has me like 2:32 a 2:34 well I am 2:38 with 2:41 hey I 2:42 \[Music\] 2:45 got your 2:48 \[Music\] 2:52 \[Applause\] 2:56 \[Music\] 3:00 does anyone know what the what is the 3:01 song what is it Heart-Shaped Box by of 3:05 course right Heart-Shaped Box by you 3:08 know I don't know 3:09 I'm serious this should be a 3:12 familiar band to you man we've had this 3:15 conversation on the first 3:17 video if it's kabu I got you here come 3:20 the haters here come the trolls right 3:22 now ulyses yes you you knew this was 3:25 coming I knew it was coming I so is this 3:28 is it can I guess is this Nirvana this 3:29 is 3:30 nirvana we figured if you can do it you 3:33 might as well be able to do it with your 3:34 band so here we are you can thank Ron 3:37 for this hey and and for the for those 3:39 that are checking it out this guilty by 3:41 association that's the only reason why I 3:42 guessed 3:43 it I did not know this before we did it 3:47 today but I can't say that for Thomas 3:49 Thomas was singing along he was like he 3:51 was rocking out over 3:52 there so the question so the question 3:56 for the cats which direction do we do we 3:58 want to go Thomas can you play that bass 3:59 line so one so here one 4:05 two i b like Balo bab oh get oh you go 4:13 \[Applause\] 4:13 \[Music\] 4:25 yeah yeah 4:28 \[Music\] 4:38 \[Music\] 4:42 whatever 4:45 there and then the I think course and 4:48 then the course and 4:52 then yeah 4:56 \[Music\] 5:02 \[Music\] 5:06 yeah something so I'm 5:09 thinking I think that fi might be so we 5:12 could do it that way I think that's the 5:14 easiest or we could or if y'all want to 5:16 swing it but I think the easiest that 5:18 will sound the best I don't know what do 5:21 yall what do y'all say I think that that 5:22 works that's the like that's like 5:24 different it's the easiest translation 5:26 still sounds like the S like I wasn't 5:28 even hearing it s the only other thing I 5:30 I would have heard it as was like a 5:32 Elven kind of like you know like a like 5:34 a train Elven kind of 5:36 thing yeah so like like what like what 5:41 tempo 5:43 though like what tempo 5:47 B oh 5:50 \[Music\] 5:55 so we can go into that we can go into 5:59 that we can start with the way we can 6:01 start the the way we had it and then go 6:03 into that that's kill start with like 6:04 the Eddie Harris and then go into that 6:07 yeah yeah cuz I think at the end like 6:08 where it kind of gets open I I do want 6:10 to put some swing in 6:11 there come on man we jazz on the course 6:14 it's like 12 bars and then it goes to 6:16 that ding ding is that I'm asking you I 6:19 I thought it was twice I mean I'm 6:21 unclear on the form I just know the one 6:23 Melody line and then the part that's 6:24 like 6:26 bowow I'm trying to figure out when it 6:28 goes to the ding 6:30 one chorus one chorus solo and then 6:34 chorus or one so uh and and Thomas when 6:38 you take stuff out front like go go off 6:41 you know like in the very beginning you 6:43 know do some and then we just going to 6:45 like Fade Out is it going to be like a 6:47 fade out or 6:48 like over the the end yeah I think so we 6:51 do a board fade yeah do a board Fade All 6:53 right so let's let's try to figure out 6:55 this version all right y'all we're going 6:56 we're going to try to do our version so 6:58 two times through the whole thing and 7:00 then we blow yeah then we blow then drum 7:02 then we take it out drums over that Vamp 7:04 you when y take it out are y'all Point 7:06 y'all poting the head out and then how 7:08 many times are you going to do the 7:08 course before I start soloing just once 7:10 we get there you start soling so yeah 7:13 when y when y'all get to that just Loop 7:15 it and when you're done ceue it and then 7:18 transition into the swing and then 7:19 whatever all right so before we get to 7:21 that final take I just want to let you 7:23 know that here at mizor we believe that 7:25 everyone would be better off if they 7:27 played a musical instrument so

got it 13:59 \[Laughter\] 14:03 okay you got to sum up that experience 14:05 for the viewers how did that 14:07 feel uh to be completely honest it felt 14:10 incredible I was I was I don't get 14:12 nervous often cuz especially when I'm in 14:14 a company of my band like they're some 14:16 of the most brilliant musicians that I 14:18 know on the planet which is why I've 14:19 asked them to play with me but I was 14:22 nervous cuz I know you guys throw a lot 14:23 of things at people uh conceptually and 14:27 so I was really wondering like I don't 14:29 know what they're going to do but how is 14:30 it going to fit into the 14:32 context of what we do right cuz there's 14:34 all this thing you know there's all 14:36 these conversations like even since I've 14:37 been with dromeo like oh you're a jazz 14:39 guy you should know or you're a jazz guy 14:41 why are you doing this so I was 14:42 wondering like whatever you were going 14:43 to give us is it going to mesh with who 14:46 we already are or how we show up 14:47 musically and what I'm really Amazed by 14:50 is how the two fit together very well 14:52 like we took an incredible song an 14:53 incredible band incredible concept and 14:55 we just messed it with who we already 14:57 are and our skill of being a jazz 14:59 musician so I I'm loving it man that 15:02 that was so much fun man this this is 15:04 incredible thank you 15:08 \[Music\]
