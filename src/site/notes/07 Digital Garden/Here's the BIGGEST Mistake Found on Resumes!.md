[Heres's the BIGGEST Mistake Found on Resumes!](https://youtu.be/IW472-d_8bs?si=uUHntCaGeQUTiehT)

## Summary (Gemini)

The biggest mistake found on resumes is not including quantifiable metrics. Recruiters and hiring managers prefer bullet points that describe the impact of the candidate's work instead of just listing their responsibilities.

The video suggests a three-step approach to address this mistake:

1. Identify relevant metrics by asking yourself how many, how often, and how long. For example, instead of saying "supervised a website renovation project," you could say "drove a 15% increase in page views and a 23% increase in session duration after helping launch a new website."
    
2. Follow the XYZ bullet point structure recommended by Google. This means starting your bullet point with a verb that describes what you accomplished, followed by "as measured by" and then the specific metric you achieved. Finally, you can add a phrase that explains how you achieved that result.
    
3. Use the Chachi Prompt to generate relevant metrics for your job if you can't think of any. The Chachi Prompt is "You are an expert resume writer with over 20 years of experience. I'm writing a bullet point for an experience on my resume but I don't know how my success was measured. I would describe my responsibilities and your task is to list five relevant metrics that I can include to quantify the impact of my work."
    

The video also includes an example of how to use this technique for someone who has been taking care of a sick family member. In this case, some relevant metrics could include the number of hours spent per week caring for the family member, the number of tasks managed simultaneously, or the number of medical appointments scheduled.
