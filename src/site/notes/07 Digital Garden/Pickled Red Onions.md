Just imagine taking a bite of a savory [pulled pork taco](https://downshiftology.com/recipes/pulled-pork-street-tacos/), with a refreshing, tart, and crisp flavor. **That sharp contrast is seriously irresistible, and why I _love_ pickled foods – especially pickled red onions.** They add a vibrant pop of red with a sweet-tart punch to your meals. And bonus, a jar of pickled onions is ridiculously easy to make.

I’ll go over more of that below, but if you haven’t ventured into pickled vegetables yet – this is your sign to do so. Plus, making pickled onions is a great place to start given how versatile onions are in a variety of dishes!

## Ingredients for Quick Pickled Red Onions

**Like most pickled foods, all you really need is your core vegetable along with water, vinegar, a sweetener, and a pinch of salt.** This is a basic formula to follow. But if you want to spice it up a bit, I’ve noted down a few ways you can add different flavors to this recipe.

-   **Red Onion**: I’m using red onions for this recipe because I’m a sucker for their color and subtle sweet flavor. But you can also use yellow onions or even shallots!
-   **Water**: You’ll just need a half cup to mix with the vinegar.
-   **Apple Cider Vinegar**: There’s a few ways you can go about using vinegar in this recipe. Apple cider vinegar is my default. But you can also use white vinegar, rice vinegar, or a combo of any two types. Just keep in mind if you mix them, it will add a different flavor.
-   **Sweetener**: Since the vinegar is quite pungent, adding honey or maple syrup will help to balance out the flavors. Plus, it will help bring out the onion’s natural sweetness!
-   **Salt**: Just a little bit is needed to round out the other flavors.

## How To Pickle Red Onions

Unlike other fermented foods (that could take days), these onions are pickled in in just _one hour_! That’s why they’re **quick pickled red onions!** I like to pickle them in a [16-ounce mason jar](https://amzn.to/2Y5cdb1), but any medium-sized container will work.

**Slice the onions.** You can use either a knife or a mandoline, just make sure to slice into thin pieces. This will make it easier for the onions to absorb the vinegar. Then place them into the mason jar.

## Give Your Pickled Onions A Flavor Boost!

These pickled red onions taste amazing as is. But if you want to switch things up a bit – here’s a few ways to add some fun flavors and give them a little boost!

-   **Stir in whole spices (see photo above).** From black peppercorns, to coriander seeds, and star anise to fennel seeds, whole spices are a great way to subtly add your favorite seasonings.
-   **Add a punch of garlic.** Stir sliced garlic pieces into the mix – this is my absolute favorite!
-   **Heat it up.** Add a dash of cayenne or red pepper flakes for a hint of spice.
-   **Add your favorite herbs.** I love to add sprigs of dill, or fresh basil and mint leaves. But you can honestly add whichever herbs you like, depending on how you want it to taste.
