Concept from [[03 References/Henry Cisneros\|Henry Cisneros]]

Housing as infrastructure is a concept that views housing not just as a physical structure but as a fundamental part of societal systems and support networks. This perspective emphasizes the importance of housing in providing stability, security, and essential services to communities. By considering housing as infrastructure, we acknowledge its role in shaping urban environments, supporting economic activities, and contributing to social well-being. This approach highlights the need for consistent maintenance and repair of existing housing stock to address issues like housing shortages, disrepair, and affordability challenges. Viewing housing through the lens of infrastructure prompts us to rethink policies, investments, and societal attitudes towards housing to ensure sustainable and equitable access to adequate shelter for all individuals.

The idea of housing as infrastructure aligns with broader discussions on the interconnectedness of social systems and the importance of maintaining prior work to support future development[2][4]. This concept underscores the significance of housing in societal functioning and the need for holistic approaches to address housing challenges effectively.
