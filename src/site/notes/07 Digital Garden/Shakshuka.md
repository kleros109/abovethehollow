## Ingredients
- ¼ cup olive oil 
- 1 medium onion, diced 
- 1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced 
- 1 Fresno chile, diced 
- 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped 
- 1 ½ teaspoons sweet paprika 
- 1 ½ teaspoons smoked paprika 
- 1 teaspoon cumin 
- 1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes 
- 6 large eggs 
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## For Serving
- 1 small bunch fresh parsley, chopped 
- 1-2 shallots 
- 1 lemon 
- Fresh pita bread 
- Za’atar 
- Softened butter 
- Garlic, minced

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400°F. 
2. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add oil. 
3. Once shimmering, add onion and peppers and saute for 6-8 minutes, or until golden brown. Reduce heat to medium-low and add garlic, paprika, and cumin and stir to combine. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until fragrant and aromatic. 
4. Add tomatoes, crushing them in your hands as they go into the skillet. Rinse can with a bit of water and add to skillet to get any remaining tomato juice. Simmer for TKTK minutes, or until the mixture reduces by 1/3rd. 
5. While the tomatoes cook, heat pita bread in preheated oven. In a small bowl, mix together softened butter, salt and garlic. Slather over top of pita bread and finish with zaatar. 
6. Once the tomato mixture is reduced, create 6 small wells using a large spoon. Crack 1 egg into each well and season each with salt and pepper. Cover and cook for 5-6 minutes, or until the whites are fully cooked, but the yolks are still runny. 
7. While the eggs are cooking, make parsley and shallot salad. Serve immediately with pita bread and salad.
