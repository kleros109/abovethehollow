> 0:00 what's up everyone Lance Hedrick here 0:01 and today I've got three air press tips 0:04 for 0:05 \[Music\] 0:08 you airpress is arguably one of the most 0:10 beloved Brewing devices on the market it 0:13 made its debut around 20 years ago and 0:15 has still captivated the pallets of 0:18 people around the 0:20 world there have been scads of recipes 0:23 posted online that have been competed 0:25 with in different championships and so 0:27 it can be a bit overwhelming for you at 0:29 home to kind of figure out what works 0:31 best for 0:32 you today I'm going to give you three 0:34 tips that will help you dial in your 0:37 coffee to your taste 0:39 preferences now these tips might be 0:42 against some of the commonly understood 0:43 ways of approaching the Aeropress so I 0:45 asked that you have an open mind as we 0:47 go through this to see if they make 0:49 tasti your cups for you cuz that is what 0:51 we are here for tasty 0:53 cups I'm not going to be doing my 0:55 recipes on here because it is slightly 0:57 different we're focusing on 1:00 the 1:05 OG one of the claims to fame of the air 1:08 press is you can make an espresso like 1:09 beverage with 1:10 it because of this a lot of people have 1:13 turned to pushing really hard in a way 1:15 that emulates I guess a pump or a lever 1:18 on an espresso 1:19 machine the harder you press on your air 1:22 press the more colloids and undissolved 1:25 compounds are going to get into your 1:27 final 1:28 cup so my first tip is actually to push 1:32 much more slowly I know that some of you 1:35 might be like that's G to take even 1:37 longer but the difference is 1:41 massive I pushed through in 6 seconds or 1:44 so a really quick powerful push just to 1:46 show the two different sides of the 1:48 equation this one I spent about a minute 1:50 just slowly pressing through 1:53 it the ideal filtration unit in an air 1:56 press in any extraction is the coffee 1:58 bed itself when you push really hard you 2:00 are forcing a lot of things that 2:02 otherwise wouldn't make it through to 2:04 make it 2:07 through then what we're going to do is 2:09 pour the resulting liquid through V60 2:12 paper filters and what you're going to 2:14 see will kind of demonstrate exactly 2:16 what I'm talking about so again this one 2:19 was the hard press this is the one where 2:20 we push really hard in order to maybe 2:23 get a thicker body which we definitely 2:25 were uh able to achieve because we saw 2:27 that cloudy Brew but it's also going to 2:28 have more stringency more bitterness and 2:31 a less enjoyable texture in general 2:34 because we're going to have we're going 2:35 to have a much more rough experience due 2:37 to all of those things that have made it 2:38 through the filtration units I ain't got 2:40 time for that look at that choke it's 2:42 just dripping at a very slow rate 2:45 because the majority of that has been 2:46 fully 2:47 clogged lots of things have been caught 2:50 in that filter lots of fines lots of 2:52 particles in general and likely a lot of 2:55 colloids that have been stuck inside the 2:57 filter that would not be ideal on the 2:59 pallet 3:02 now we will do the slow pressed one so 3:04 let's start the timer and we'll have a 3:06 little spillage but it's 3:09 okay all 3:15 right there we go 34 35 seconds and we 3:20 have the filter is completely gone 3:23 there's a little bit at the very tip but 3:26 that's just going to be difficult to get 3:27 out without any contact points maybe if 3:28 we put it on on the side it'll 3:35 go slow 3:38 press similar to a V60 in the sense that 3:40 the flavors are really clean really 3:42 clear but it's really juicy it has a 3:43 much nicer mouth feel than what you 3:46 could ever get on something like a V60 3:48 or an origami or an ory or something 3:50 like 3:52 that this one obviously has a much 3:54 thicker body but it's rougher on the 3:56 tongue it's kind of like um it has 3:58 drying aspects about it it has a little 4:00 AR stringency on the Finish still a 4:02 decent cup don't get me wrong but 4:03 definitely this is my preference it's 4:05 much more sparkling much more clear much 4:07 more clean in 4:11 general granted this one had you know a 4:14 bit more contact time because we were 4:15 pressing so slowly the bit that was left 4:17 was having more exposure to the slurry 4:19 but in reality these are similar 4:21 extraction yields and you just have one 4:24 that tastes a lot better than the 4:26 other the next tip for better air 4:29 presses is actually something I didn't 4:31 do in the first one cuz I didn't want to 4:32 ruin the surprise but it's actually to 4:34 bloom your 4:37 coffee blooming doesn't matter nearly as 4:39 much when you're doing the inverted 4:40 method but that's a less and less common 4:42 practice nowadays because of the 4:44 potential injury whenever you're doing 4:45 that but when you do the typical air 4:48 press having a bloom and having no Bloom 4:50 have a big big difference you will 4:53 notice if you pour it all in at once you 4:55 have a lot of liquid that drips through 4:56 into that Final Cup now that liquid is 4:59 going to to be severely undere extracted 5:01 very teal likee not much coffee in it at 5:03 all and that's because in order for 5:05 extraction to really occur those grounds 5:07 need to be saturated quite well okay 5:10 we're up to the four now I would put the 5:11 plunger on and we move it over all right 5:14 so we have 20.5 G so let's get a little 5:18 swirl on 5:20 there I'm takeing samp the grounds need 5:23 to be saturated in order for diffusion 5:25 to begin to occur because they need to 5:26 be degassed the water needs to actually 5:28 get all the way into the grounds before 5:29 you're able to really start to extract 5:31 the yummies if you want to get to taste 5:33 Town it takes a little time this time 5:36 I'm going to bloom it for about 45 5:37 seconds and Pour It Up just shy of 5:39 number four to take into account what 5:41 may have dropped into the 5:42 cup when you do a bloom you have some 5:45 minimal amount of water that goes 5:47 through but because the bed absorbs 5:49 roughly twice its weight in water you're 5:51 able to actually use a lot of that water 5:54 to get that saturation point up and 5:56 allow the diffusion to occur when you 5:58 pour the rest of your water 6:00 in so as you can see there are still 6:02 droplets because the it the the grounds 6:05 aren't so efficient to be able to suck 6:06 all up all that water immediately so 6:08 some does make it through but then after 6:10 about 45 seconds We'll pour the rest of 6:12 the water in and we'll stop it at that 6:13 20.5 G or as close as we can 6:21 get all right so we stopped it at 21 6:23 it's quite 6:25 close not ideal because when measuring 6:27 concentrations you want it to be 6:28 identical but I think this is good 6:30 enough for our 6:32 purposes this one was at 6:34 3.56 whereas the previous one was at 6:38 2.10 that is a huge increase in the 6:41 amount that was able to get into that 6:42 Final Cup meaning we're not diluting the 6:44 beverage as much we're getting more of 6:46 that extraction early on so you're not 6:48 having to waste a lot of water diluting 6:49 your Brew you can have a more efficient 6:51 extraction with that blooming 6:56 phase you may still prefer a more a 6:59 weaker extraction which is absolutely 7:01 fine I'm not someone that advocates for 7:03 26% extraction but just know that you 7:07 can use less water for more flavorful 7:09 Brew if you're using the 7:13 bloom now the final tip is probably the 7:16 most counterintuitive and it's because 7:18 it's been drilled in your head for so 7:20 long that it's going to be hard to shake 7:23 off it deals with grind 7:27 size oh on our grinder 7:30 this range is for espresso this range is 7:32 for mocha poot on the other end this is 7:34 French press this is kimx a lot of times 7:36 you see people adding aor press range 7:39 which is on a the very fine side of 7:43 things Alan Adler the inventor of the a 7:46 press didn't even grind that finely he 7:47 went a lot cooler and a bit coarser but 7:50 over time people started to go really 7:52 fine because they were trying to emulate 7:54 espresso with the a 7:56 press I'm not saying that finally air 8:00 presses don't taste good but what I am 8:02 saying is a lot of you get stuck in this 8:04 mindset that it must be really fine for 8:06 it to be an air press that's simply not 8:08 the 8:10 case the courser you go the more even 8:13 the flow through that coffee bed so with 8:15 every Brew method I always recommend 8:17 people to start as coar as you can 8:18 really go and then you go finer and 8:21 finer until you land on The Sweet Spot 8:24 the more fine you go the more potential 8:25 stringency the finer you go the flow 8:27 through the puck might be more and more 8:29 un 8:32 even it's not bad to let that sit a 8:35 little bit longer in fact Jonathan G A 8:37 friend of mine has a 10-minute air press 8:39 recipe that a lot of people really like 8:42 think about coffee cuppings you people 8:44 don't even start sipping those till the 8:45 10-minute marker anyway as an immersion 8:48 Brew sits for a long time especially 8:50 because there's no real percolation 8:51 going on it's not going to affect the 8:53 extraction that much Beyond minute 8:55 marker 3 because what is capable of 8:58 being extracted wants to come out pretty 9:00 quickly especially depending on your 9:02 grind size and your water 9:05 temperature a little bonus one is I also 9:07 recommend not going super 9:10 hot and I recently posted a video right 9:13 here of a weird AER pressed recipe where 9:15 you're using 78 to 80° water and it 9:18 tastes really great I never really go 9:21 over 95° even with the lightest of light 9:23 roasts on an air press and there A lot 9:25 of times it's only around 90 or 91° if 9:28 not even cooler than that and what I 9:30 find is a direct correlation between 9:32 that and the perceived 9:35 bitterness I will put Jonathan G's blog 9:38 post below about what is causing EST 9:40 stringency based off conversations 9:41 between himself and S 9:44 SM everything that I kind of try and do 9:46 is to reduce bitterness reduce harshness 9:49 reduce that accurate perception and 9:51 reduce 9:56 astringency wonder how it tastes now 10:00 I like to do 15 G of coffee I like to do 10:03 250 g of water just like on my 10:06 V60 I might up that amount of coffee to 10:09 16 gram for maybe medium roasted coffees 10:12 and up to 17 gram if you like darker 10:14 roasted 10:18 coffees you can go coarser obviously and 10:20 I do on occasion especially if it's 10:23 maybe a really old coffee or a really uh 10:25 processed coffee this is a washed coffee 10:27 so I go a little finer than my usual 10:30 I do around 92° C if you're at medium 10:33 maybe go to 88 if you're at dark maybe 10:35 go to like 82 to 84 and just play around 10:38 with that first things first I always 10:40 like to level the bed in here if you 10:42 just dump it in and start pouring you 10:44 can have a much shallower part on one 10:46 side of the bed which can allow water to 10:47 immediately get into that cup we want to 10:50 make sure as much water as possible is 10:51 retained in that bed during our bloom in 10:54 fact if you have a mellow drip or 10:56 something that can allow you to just 10:57 barely like wet the on the top and it'll 11:00 go through the bed more slowly that can 11:02 be a really good thing you can kind of 11:03 swirl it to help even out the the the 11:06 wetness of the bed but I'm going to pour 11:08 nice and slow let the water stream kind 11:10 of break up before it hits the bed so it 11:12 doesn't penetrate as deep that way I can 11:14 control kind of how much water is 11:16 getting through into the mug during that 11:19 balloon I like to give it a swirl just 11:21 to make sure everything is nicely wetted 11:24 as you see we had some drops coming 11:25 through once I swirled it but it pretty 11:27 much stayed in there before the swirl 11:28 occurred 11:29 now as you notice I'm not getting the 11:31 kettle back up to Temp I'm not very 11:33 worried about temperature with aor press 11:35 once we do that push through it actually 11:37 AIDS in some of that like emuls 11:39 emulsifying and it forces through a lot 11:41 of that liquid retain ratio that could 11:43 be in the grounds we're getting a a 11:45 pretty pretty solid extraction with this 11:46 with this Brew method so at 45 seconds 11:49 I'm going to pour up to 11:51 250 I do a kind of little circle just to 11:53 make sure all the grounds are integrated 11:55 and I just kind of pour in the center 11:57 nothing super fancy on the pour itself 12:01 getting it up to 250 relatively 12:04 quickly there we are and then I just set 12:06 the plunger right at the top to kind of 12:08 stop the drops coming through move it to 12:11 the side because you don't want to press 12:12 onto a scale and I give it a little 12:15 swirl just like so now I'm going to wait 12:17 till the 2-minute mark So we had 45 12:19 second Bloom then with all the water in 12:21 we let it sit about a minute 15 you can 12:23 of course go longer than this if you 12:25 don't feel like it had adequate 12:26 extraction it won't extract a ton more 12:28 after 2 minutes but it will continue to 12:30 extract certainly so overall it'll be 12:33 about a 3 minute process from the first 12:35 drop to the final go so as you see I'm 12:38 barely pushing at all it's almost just 12:40 the weight of my hand just barely 12:41 pushing which allows for more clean and 12:44 even flow through the coffee I do not 12:47 press through the HS the more you press 12:49 at the end the more the potential string 12:51 of particles can get into your 12:53 cup pull this up a bit so it stops it 13:00 we have our cup of 13:03 coffee it's absolutely 13:06 fantastic Do not sit there and try to 13:09 push all of your weight into the air 13:11 press go nice and slow try that out I 13:13 like it you may not and that's 13:15 completely 13:17 okay try giving your air press a bloom 13:20 go to the normal way of Brewing it where 13:21 you have the air press right in the 13:23 decanter Bloom it for a bit if you're 13:24 not already doing that and then pour to 13:26 your target weight I then like to 13:28 immediately put the plunger in so that 13:30 no more is dripping out as I like to 13:32 have that kind of immersion percolation 13:34 kind of blend and then slowly press 13:37 through don't go so fine try out some 13:40 coarser grounds it's not going to give 13:41 you as much resistance but you're not 13:43 pushing hard anyway cuz we're trying to 13:44 maintain the Integrity of the bed we're 13:46 trying to lessen the amount of those 13:48 particles that can get through the def 13:49 Final Cup which can obfuscate your palet 13:52 make just a much tastier Brew all 13:55 around give these three tips a try let 13:58 me know below if it works for you if you 14:00 want to try out the recipe have at it 14:01 just remember there are variables that 14:03 you can control in order to optimize it 14:05 for your specific 14:07 coffee if you enjoy what you see please 14:09 you know hit the like hit the
