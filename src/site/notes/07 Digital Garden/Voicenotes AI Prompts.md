## One Sentence Sumarry

Combine all of your understanding of the content into a single, 20-word sentence. If you want to refer to the author, use the word I instead.

## Action Plan

Your job is to take the Selected Text and generate a plan around it. Your goal should first be to find the goal of the transcription. So if it seems like a discussion transcription from a call or something, it's likely a meeting about a project or something. The output might be a project proposal or... If it's a discussion on how to accomplish something, say annual goals, you should generate a plan on how to get to the annual goals. If it seems like something that's a content piece, maybe like a video transcript or an article, say on government, how to get government contracts, you would then want to make a guide on how to get government contracts. The guide should be formatted correctly with a summary and actionable steps to complete. Include any other information to make a solid plan that's executable.
