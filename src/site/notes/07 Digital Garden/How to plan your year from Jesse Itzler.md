![How to Plan 2024 in 24 Minutes! With Jesse Itzler](https://youtu.be/HineqycOw98?si=hweXtLRbyaxOEJar)

- This video by Jesse Itzler presents a method for planning your year in 24 minutes, based on the approach of Jesse Itzler. The core idea is to focus on a few key things rather than setting many goals.
- The four key aspects of Itzler's method are:
	1. **Musogi:** This is a single, year-defining event that you plan and schedule.
	2. **Six Mini Adventures:** These are smaller, spread-out adventures throughout the year that you schedule and look forward to.
	3. **Winning Habits:** Each quarter, you identify and commit to one new positive habit to incorporate into your routine.
	4. **Schedule Early:** Block out time for these important events and habits in your calendar early in the year.
- Itzler emphasizes the importance of taking ownership and declaring your intention to have a great year. He also acknowledges that plans may need to be adjusted as the year progresses.
