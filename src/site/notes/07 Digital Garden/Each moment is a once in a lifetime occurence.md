> ### Ichi-go ichi-e
> How many moments do we miss?
> 
> In Japanese tea ceremonies, there is a common phrase: Ichi-go ichi-e.
> Translated, it means "for this time only". The idea is that each moment is a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence.
> 
> The lesson is to cherish each moment while you are in it.
> 
> When you live with ichi-go ichi-e as your focus, the world changes. Interactions are deeper; moments are sweeter. It's a beautiful reminder of the subtle joy and wonder that accompanies life.
> 
> And for me, ichi-go ichi-e is motivational, too. When I get rushed (as I often do) or miss a moment, I don't have to spend a lot of time wringing my hands because there is another ichi-go ichi-e moment immediately before me.
> 
> When the world tries to speed you up, ichi-go ichi-e reminds you to slow down and enjoy the moment you are in "for this time only."
