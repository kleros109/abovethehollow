## Summary
Charles Mingus describes himself as having three parts: a calm observer, a fearful attacker, and a trusting person who can be hurt. He believes that true creativity lies in making complicated things simple, rather than just playing weird sounds. Mingus's thoughts reflect the complexity of human emotions and the art of jazz.
